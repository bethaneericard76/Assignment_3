<p>NEW YORK, NY – Families in the Bronx are among the most childcare cost-burdened and pay a higher percentage of their incomes toward child care, according to a 2023 report by the Citizens’ Committee for Children of NY. The neighborhood Hunts Point in particular have the lowest median incomes but spend as much as 63% of their income on infant and toddler care, resulting in parents leaving the workforce to tend to their child(ren). Less kids in attendance combined with low wages means more facilities are susceptible to shutting down, further exacerbating the issue of childcare deserts in the borough. Lorisa Toribio, contributor to The Century Foundation, explained, “Childcare in the city is funded and regulated by a combination of state and local agencies such as the DOH (Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) and OCFS (Office of Child and Family Services) that offer patchwork solutions and ill-funded services that hurt both childcare worker and child.” </p>
